Asteroids Recreation

A simple recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids in Unity. This project demonstrates basic game mechanics such as ship movement, shooting, asteroid splitting and collision detection.

PlayerMovement (Ship)  
-Rotation: Press keys A / Left Arrow and D / Right Arrow to rotate the ship.  
-Thrust Mechanic: Press W / Up Arrow to apply forward thrust.  
-The ship maintains momentum in space, requiring careful control to avoid drifting into danger.  
-Shooting: Press Spacebar/LeftClick to fire bullets in the direction the ship is facing.  

Collision Detection  
-If the ship collides with an asteroid, the player loses a life.  
-The ship respawns after destruction until all lives are lost.  

Asteroids  
-Random Generation: Asteroids spawn at random positions and move in random directions.  
-Fragmentation: Large asteroids break into smaller ones when hit.  

Scoring  
-Gain points by destroying asteroids.  
-Smaller asteroid fragments give higher points since they are harder to hit.  
-The score resets to 0 when dying.  

Visuals & Effects  
-Basic particle effects for explosions (shooting asteroids and the dying).    
-The background is static space, emphasizing the arcade feel.
